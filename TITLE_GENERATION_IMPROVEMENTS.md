# Title Generation Improvements

## Problem Identified
The previous title generation prompts were too generic and resulted in repetitive, buzzword-heavy titles like:
- "Revolutionizing Customer Service"
- "Transforming Business Operations"
- "The Future of AI"
- Generic phrases that don't capture the unique value of each case study

## Solution Implemented
Updated all title generation prompts across the application with specific, high-quality instructions that focus on creating unique, attractive titles for each case study.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Specific Quality Requirements**
- Titles must be SPECIFIC to each case study (not generic)
- ATTRACTIVE and compelling for business readers
- 6-10 words maximum
- Based on ACTUAL solution and results from the transcript
- Professional yet engaging

### 2. **Explicitly Forbidden Patterns**
- ❌ "Revolutionizing" anything
- ❌ "Transforming" everything  
- ❌ "The Future of" anything
- ❌ Generic buzzwords like "Innovation," "Breakthrough," "Game-changer"
- ❌ Company x Client: Project Name format

### 3. **Excellent Title Examples**
Provided concrete examples of high-quality titles:
- "From 3 Hours to 15 Minutes: How AI Streamlined Our Onboarding"
- "The Chatbot That Reduced Support Tickets by 70%"
- "How We Built a System That Handles 10,000 Users Daily"
- "The Automation That Saved Our Team 20 Hours Every Week"
- "How Data Analytics Unlocked 40% More Revenue"

### 4. **Title Creation Strategy**
Step-by-step approach:
1. Identify the SPECIFIC problem solved from the transcript
2. Find the CONCRETE results or metrics mentioned
3. Use ACTION words that describe what actually happened
4. Make it SPECIFIC to this client's industry or challenge
5. Focus on TANGIBLE outcomes, not abstract concepts

### 5. **Title Patterns to Use**
Specific templates for creating good titles:
- "How [Specific Solution] [Specific Result]"
- "The [Solution Type] That [Specific Outcome]"
- "From [Before] to [After]: How [Solution] [Result]"
- "[Specific Metric] Improvement Through [Solution]"
- "How [Solution] [Specific Action] [Specific Result]"

## Files Updated

1. **`app/routes/main.py`** - Main interview processing route
2. **`app/services/case_study_service.py`** - Both prompts for full case study generation

## Expected Results

With these improvements, you should now see titles that are:
- **Specific** to each case study's unique solution and results
- **Attractive** and compelling for business readers
- **Varied** across different case studies
- **Professional** yet engaging
- **Action-oriented** with concrete outcomes
- **Free from buzzwords** like "revolutionizing" and "transforming"

## Example Transformation

**Before (Old Prompts):**
- "Revolutionizing Customer Service with AI"

**After (New Prompts):**
- "How AI Chatbots Reduced Support Wait Times by 80%"

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Generate new case studies using the updated prompts
2. Verify that titles are specific and attractive
3. Check that no generic buzzwords are used
4. Ensure each title captures the unique value of its case study

The new prompts should significantly improve the quality and variety of case study titles, making them more engaging and professional for business audiences.
