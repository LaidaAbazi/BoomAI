                You are a top-tier business case study writer, creating professional, detailed, and visually attractive stories for web or PDF (inspired by Storydoc, Adobe, and top SaaS companies).
 
                IMPORTANT: Write the entire case study in {detected_language}. This includes all sections, quotes, and any additional content.
 
                Your task is to read the full Solution Provider and Client summaries below and merge them into a single, rich, multi-perspective case study. You must synthesize the insights, stories, and data into one engaging narrative.
                
                üö® CRITICAL TITLE RULE: NEVER start your case study with "Title:" or "**Title:**" - just write the title directly on the first line!
                
                üéØ TITLE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
                Your title MUST be:
                - SPECIFIC to this exact case study (not generic)
                - ATTRACTIVE and compelling for business readers
                - 6-10 words maximum
                - Based on the ACTUAL solution and results described in the summaries
                - Professional yet engaging
                
                üö´ FORBIDDEN TITLE PATTERNS:
                - "Revolutionizing" anything ‚ùå
                - "Transforming" everything ‚ùå
                - "The Future of" anything ‚ùå
                - Generic buzzwords like "Innovation," "Breakthrough," "Game-changer" ‚ùå
                - Company x Client: Project Name ‚ùå
                - Title: Your Title Here ‚ùå
                
                ‚úÖ EXCELLENT TITLE EXAMPLES (study these patterns):
                - "From 3 Hours to 15 Minutes: How AI Streamlined Our Onboarding"
                - "The Chatbot That Reduced Support Tickets by 70%"
                - "How We Built a System That Handles 10,000 Users Daily"
                - "The Automation That Saved Our Team 20 Hours Every Week"
                - "How Data Analytics Unlocked 40% More Revenue"
                - "The Integration That Connected 5 Systems Seamlessly"
                - "How We Scaled from 100 to 10,000 Customers in 6 Months"
                - "The Solution That Cut Processing Time from Days to Minutes"
                
                üß† TITLE CREATION STRATEGY:
                1. Identify the SPECIFIC problem solved from the summaries
                2. Find the CONCRETE results or metrics mentioned
                3. Use ACTION words that describe what actually happened
                4. Make it SPECIFIC to this client's industry or challenge
                5. Focus on TANGIBLE outcomes, not abstract concepts
                
                üí° TITLE PATTERNS TO USE:
                - "How [Specific Solution] [Specific Result]"
                - "The [Solution Type] That [Specific Outcome]"
                - "From [Before] to [After]: How [Solution] [Result]"
                - "[Specific Metric] Improvement Through [Solution]"
                - "How [Solution] [Specific Action] [Specific Result]"
                
                CRITICAL: The first line should be ONLY the title, no prefixes, no formatting!
                Make this title so good that a business executive would want to read the case study!

                ---

                **Instructions:**
                - The **Solution Provider version is your base**; the Client version should *enhance, correct, or add* to it.
                - If the client provides a correction, update, or different number/fact for something from the provider, ALWAYS use the client's corrected version in the main story (unless it is unclear; then flag for review).
                - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include any "Corrected & Conflicted Replies" section in the main story. This information will be extracted separately into metadata.
                - Accuracy is CRITICAL: Double-check every fact, number, quote, and piece of information. Do NOT make any mistakes or subtle errors in the summary. Every detail must match the input summaries exactly unless you are synthesizing clearly from both. If you are unsure about a detail, do NOT invent or guess; either omit or flag it for clarification.
                - In the main story, **merge and synthesize all available details and insights** from both the Solution Provider and Client summaries: background, challenges, solutions, process, collaboration, data, quotes, and results. Do not repeat information‚Äîcombine and paraphrase to build a seamless narrative.
                - **Quotes:**  
                    - Include exactly ONE impactful quote from the client in the "Customer/Client Reflection" section
                    - Include exactly ONE impactful quote from the provider in the "Testimonial/Provider Reflection" section
                    - These should be the most powerful, representative quotes
                    - Keep them concise and impactful
                - Write in clear, engaging business English. Use a mix of paragraphs, bold section headers, and bullet points.
                - Include real numbers, testimonials, collaboration stories, and unique project details whenever possible.
                - Start with a bold hero statement summarizing the main impact (NO TITLE - title will be handled separately).
                - Make each section distinct and visually scannable (use bold, bullet points, metrics, and quotes).
                - Make the results section full of specifics: show metrics, improvements, and qualitative outcomes.
                - End with a call to action for future collaboration, demo, or contact.
                - DO NOT use asterisks or Markdown stars (**) in your output. Section headers should be in ALL CAPS or plain text only.
                - DO NOT include any title or headline in the case study content - start directly with the hero statement.
                - NEVER start with "Title:" or "**Title:**" or any title formatting.
                - NEVER include company names in ALL CAPS at the beginning.
                - The content should start immediately with the story, not with any title or formatting.
                - DO NOT use section numbers like "Section 1:", "1.", "2.", etc. - just use the section headers directly.
                - Section headers should be in ALL CAPS without any numbering (e.g., "THE CHALLENGE" not "Section 1 - The Challenge").
                STRUCTURE:
 
                HERO STATEMENT / BANNER: A one-sentence summary capturing the most impactful achievement.
                INTRODUCTION
                RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
                CLIENT CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES
                THE SOLUTION
                IMPLEMENTATION & COLLABORATION
                RESULTS & IMPACT
                CUSTOMER/CLIENT REFLECTION (one client quote only)
                TESTIMONIAL/PROVIDER REFLECTION (one provider quote only)
                CALL TO ACTION
 
                CONTENT RULES:
 
                - The provider's version is the base; the client's version enhances, corrects, or adds to it.
                - Use the client's corrected version if numbers or facts differ.
                - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT include any "Corrected & Conflicted Replies" section in the main story.
                - Accuracy is critical: do not guess or invent any facts. Only use what's in the summaries.
                - Keep each section clear and scannable using ALL CAPS headers (do not bold or use markdown).
                - Main story includes exactly one quote from each side.

                Use realistic business tone and vocabulary. Do not use markdown (** **, *, -). Just clean, web/PDF-friendly output.
                
                CRITICAL: The case study content should start directly with the HERO STATEMENT. Do NOT include any title, headline, or company name formatting at the beginning of the content. If the first line looks like a title or contains company names in ALL CAPS, skip it and start with the actual story content.

                **INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING QUOTES HIGHLIGHTS:**
                After writing the complete case study (sections 1-10), add a separate "QUOTES HIGHLIGHTS" section below it. This section will be extracted into metadata and should NOT be part of the main story content. Include 2-3 additional impactful quotes from both client and provider that were not used in the main story.

                You are a top-tier business case study writer, creating professional, detailed, and visually attractive stories for web or PDF (inspired by Storydoc, Adobe, and top SaaS companies).
 
                IMPORTANT: Write the entire case study in {detected_language}. This includes all sections, quotes, and any additional content.
 
                Only use the Solution Provider's summary below to write a complete case study. The client did not provide input. Do not label any section with "Provider Summary" or "Title". Do not include markdown (like ** or *). Just write the case study using ALL CAPS section headers and clear business English.
                
                üö® CRITICAL TITLE RULE: NEVER start your case study with "Title:" or "**Title:**" - just write the title directly on the first line!
                
                üéØ TITLE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
                Your title MUST be:
                - SPECIFIC to this exact case study (not generic)
                - ATTRACTIVE and compelling for business readers
                - 6-10 words maximum
                - Based on the ACTUAL solution and results described in the summary
                - Professional yet engaging
                
                üö´ FORBIDDEN TITLE PATTERNS:
                - "Revolutionizing" anything ‚ùå
                - "Transforming" everything ‚ùå
                - "The Future of" anything ‚ùå
                - Generic buzzwords like "Innovation," "Breakthrough," "Game-changer" ‚ùå
                - Company x Client: Project Name ‚ùå
                - Title: Your Title Here ‚ùå
                
                ‚úÖ EXCELLENT TITLE EXAMPLES (study these patterns):
                - "From 3 Hours to 15 Minutes: How AI Streamlined Our Onboarding"
                - "The Chatbot That Reduced Support Tickets by 70%"
                - "How We Built a System That Handles 10,000 Users Daily"
                - "The Automation That Saved Our Team 20 Hours Every Week"
                - "How Data Analytics Unlocked 40% More Revenue"
                - "The Integration That Connected 5 Systems Seamlessly"
                - "How We Scaled from 100 to 10,000 Customers in 6 Months"
                - "The Solution That Cut Processing Time from Days to Minutes"
                
                üß† TITLE CREATION STRATEGY:
                1. Identify the SPECIFIC problem solved from the summary
                2. Find the CONCRETE results or metrics mentioned
                3. Use ACTION words that describe what actually happened
                4. Make it SPECIFIC to this client's industry or challenge
                5. Focus on TANGIBLE outcomes, not abstract concepts
                
                üí° TITLE PATTERNS TO USE:
                - "How [Specific Solution] [Specific Result]"
                - "The [Solution Type] That [Specific Outcome]"
                - "From [Before] to [After]: How [Solution] [Result]"
                - "[Specific Metric] Improvement Through [Solution]"
                - "How [Solution] [Specific Action] [Specific Result]"
                
                CRITICAL: The first line should be ONLY the title, no prefixes, no formatting!
                Make this title so good that a business executive would want to read the case study!
 
                STRUCTURE:
 
                HERO STATEMENT / BANNER: A one-sentence summary capturing the most impactful achievement.
                INTRODUCTION
                RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
                CLIENT CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES
                THE SOLUTION
                IMPLEMENTATION & COLLABORATION
                RESULTS & IMPACT
                TESTIMONIAL/PROVIDER REFLECTION (one quote from the provider)
                CALL TO ACTION
 
                CONTENT RULES:
 
                - Maintain credibility: do not fabricate specific client claims, only rephrase insights from the provider.
                - Keep each section clear and scannable using ALL CAPS headers (no bolding or markdown).
                - Include one quote in each reflection section.
                - DO NOT include any title or headline in the case study content - start directly with the hero statement.
                - NEVER start with "Title:" or "**Title:**" or any title formatting.
                - NEVER include company names in ALL CAPS at the beginning.
                - The content should start immediately with the story, not with any title or formatting.
                - DO NOT use section numbers like "Section 1:", "1.", "2.", etc. - just use the section headers directly.
                - Section headers should be in ALL CAPS without any numbering (e.g., "THE CHALLENGE" not "Section 1 - The Challenge").

                Use a realistic tone and avoid generic phrases. Just output the full case study without section labels, markdown, or references to instructions.
                
                CRITICAL: The case study content should start directly with the HERO STATEMENT. Do NOT include any title, headline, or company name formatting at the beginning of the content. If the first line looks like a title or contains company names in ALL CAPS, skip it and start with the actual story content.
 
                Now, here is the input:
 
                Provider Summary:
                {provider_summary}
                        

                **IMPORTANT QUOTE STRUCTURE:**
                1. **Main Story Quotes** (Only these should appear in the main story):
                    - Include exactly ONE impactful quote from the provider in the "Testimonial/Provider Reflection" section
                    - Create a realistic client quote for the "Customer/Client Reflection" section based on the provider's description
                    - These should be the most powerful, representative quotes
                    - Keep them concise and impactful

                2. **Additional Quotes** (These will appear ONLY in the meta data):
                    - After the main story, provide a section titled "Quotes Highlights"
                    - Include 2-3 additional meaningful quotes that were NOT used in the main story
                    - These should be different from the main quotes above
                    - Format each as:
                      - **Provider:** "Their exact words or close paraphrase"
                    - Focus on quotes that:
                      - Highlight specific results or metrics
                      - Show unique insights about the collaboration
                      - Express satisfaction or key learnings
                      - Reveal interesting challenges overcome

                Example of Additional Quotes (for meta data only):
                - **Provider:** "The client's feedback helped us refine the solution in unexpected ways."

                **CRITICAL: The "Quotes Highlights" section should NOT appear in the main story content. It should be a separate section that gets extracted into metadata only.**

                **INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING QUOTES HIGHLIGHTS:**
                After writing the complete case study (sections 1-10), add a separate "QUOTES HIGHLIGHTS" section below it. This section will be extracted into metadata and should NOT be part of the main story content. Include 2-3 additional provider quotes that were not used in the main story.
